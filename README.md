# Density change - Smart materials
As part of a doctoral thesis in the technological laboratory at Reichman University, I Designed, programmed and analysed Auxetic structures (geometric patterns) 
that affect the characteristics of the fabric.

Background -

Creating a simulation of fabrics cut according to auxetic structures in order to test the programming of changing the density of the material in the fabric.
Ways taken into account in order to create the change in the material - cutting, blowing, heating and moisture.
The purpose of the project is to shorten the process of researching auxetic patterns in that any change can be made in the simulation easily
and we will not have to cut the fabrics in reality.

- Working with Rhino - Grasshopper and using python

Description of the work process -

1. I have chosen familiar auxetic structures that I will use in the simulation.
2. I cut real fabric by laser cutting according to the Auxestic structure I chose to check the change that happens in the fabric following the cutting.
   This is in order to see that indeed the fabric reacts as I expected and I will know that I do need to start the process of creating the simulation.
3. I performed analytical calculations of the auxetic structures so that I could put this data into the code.
4. I chose a suitable software where I can write code and also see a visual output of the simulation.
5. I learned to use the software and built small projects so that I would be familiar with the tools it has.
6. I created the simulation with the Auxetic structure I chose using the Python programming language.
